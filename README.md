# Frontier-Based-Exploration-and-Navigation-of-Autonomous-Robot

The process of exploration of the environment by an Autonomous robot consists of three steps:
1. Exploring the region around the robot to the extent to which the robotâ€™s sensors can reach.
2. Next is to find the location to which the robot should move to explore further.
3. Check whether the environment is mapped completely to know when to stop the exploration.
Frontier based exploration encompasses of these steps.
